the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).

== Author Notes ==

While tools were available around the web for integrating certain features of the Battle.net API into a wordpress site
I found that none of them had a complete feature set, or were horrible to try and pull additional data from outside of
what each tool's intended purpose was. Thus WoWAT was born, part acronym, part WAT?!? this plugin was developed to teach 
myself how to build a plugin for wordpress.

== A brief Markdown Example ==

            "Markdown is what the parser uses to process much of the readme file"

Markdown uses email style notation for blockquotes and I've been told:
> Asterisks for *emphasis*. Double it up  for **strong**.

`<?php code(); // goes in backticks ?>`
